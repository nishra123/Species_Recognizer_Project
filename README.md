# Species_Recognizer_Project
Here, I used YOLO-COCO Model for species recognition from an image.

For YOLO-COCO model, the coco.names, yolov3.cfg and yolo.weights file were downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/yolo-coco-data


The Species recognition model is integrated into a website using streamlit.

Use command : streamlit run app.py
upload image and get the results.
